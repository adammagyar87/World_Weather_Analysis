# World_Weather_Analysis
After creating a beta version of a trip planning app utilizing APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps, feedback suggested adding the weather description to the weather data that was already retrieved. 
An input was added requesting the user's temperature preferences to help identify hotels in the areas they would be interested in.
Based on the customers feedback on 4 cities they would like to travel to, route directions were created via the Google Maps Directions API with markers and descriptions at each hotel.
